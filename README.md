This project provides a web-based dashboard for 
monitoring crop health and pest/disease risks at
the district level in Lesotho. It integrates satellite 
data from Google Earth Engine with machine learning models 
to generate actionable insights for farmers, researchers, and policymakers.

The dashboard shows numerical summaries of key environmental 
variables and crop health indicators and displays interactive
maps of vegetation indices and soil parameters.
